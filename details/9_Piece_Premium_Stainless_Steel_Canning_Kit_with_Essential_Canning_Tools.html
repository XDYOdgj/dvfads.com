Smith","content":"This has nearly everything you need for canning! I love this kit and have used it several times already. I'm quite happy with it.","purchase_model":"Color: Green Color: Green  Reviews","score":"5.0","date":"2024-05-24 15:34:06"},{"user":"Debra Brinkman","content":"I got this specifically because my daughter-in-law, who just moved out of state, has been wanting to start canning and so I had gathered up some of my supplies to give to her.This seemed a great way to replenish!They surprised me with a (late) Mother's Day two-day visit, arriving the morning this kit came.So I pulled things out so we could make some jelly and learn a bit about water-bath canning.I have been canning for about 45 years (and helping my mom before that), and one thing I have really learned to appreciate is having the right tools for the job.This set includes all of my must-have items, plus a couple.So, roughly in order of my opinion on how much these things matter, here is my take on the items in this kit:Canning rack - this does the job it needs to, keeping the glass jars off the bottom of the canner.The handles fit great on every pot I tried for holding the jars up and out of the water when preparing them or when pulling them out.Jar lifter - this is sturdy and easy-to-use.It worked great on the tiny 1/2 and 1/4 pint jars we were using for jelly, and I also tried it out on some already canned quart jars, just to be sure it gets a solid grip of a heavy jar.This is hugely important for placing jars in the hot canner, and for pulling them out.Canning funnel - this is something my mom didn't have back in the day, and I hate canning without one.Something I love about this one is that you can collapse it down so it doesn't take up much space for storage.Love, love that.The funnel works great in both regular and wide-mouth jars.Headspace/bubble remover - this gadget is so handy.Getting air bubbles out is really important, and this is safer than using a knife or something like that.As long as the measurement part is accurate, this is a device that is really hard to get wrong.It doesn't have to be really sturdy or anything.This one totally works.Jar opener - I never end up storing these with my actual canning supplies, but as you should not be storing the jars with the rings on them, it would make sense to do so.These are fantastic for removing the rings, and I use these on all kinds of store-bought product as well.Magnetic lid lifter - these are handy for getting lids out of simmering water, but definitely read up on guidelines to know what you do need to do with the lids.Canning tongs - I'll confess, I've never figured out what these are specifically for.This pair seems well made, but I'll end up misplacing it and never noticing that it is MIA.So, bottom line, this is a very serviceable set.","purchase_model":"Color: Green Color: Green  Reviews","score":"5.0","date":"2023-05-18 15:34:06"},{"user":"Crystalfern","content":"I am very happy with this seven piece canning set . It has everything I need to do my canning except for the tomatoes that are out there on the vine right now. It had an extra piece in this set. I never had before usef for opening and tightening jar lids. I think that will be very useful over the coming years. I believe It has everything I need to do my canning except for the tomatoes that are out there on the vine right now. It had a extra piece in this set. I never had before use for opening and tightening jar lids. I think that will be very useful over the coming years. I believe the set will last for years because it is made of stainless steel. I really like having the extra canning rack. Also it\u2019s a very good and convenient size for my pots. I would recommend this set whether you\u2019re a beginner or been at it for 60 years I feel the set is well-made, attractive and very useful and seven well-made pieces for 20 bucks at today\u2019s prices. That\u2019s a pretty good deal.","purchase_model":"Color: Green Color: Green  Reviews","score":"5.0","date":"2023-05-20 15:34:06"},{"user":"WendyInWV","content":"I wanted to try this set of canning tools because I expect I'll need to be canning quite a bit of tomato sauce this year, as I'm experimenting growing three varieties of \"sauce\" tomatoes to decide which one grows and tastes best for making sauce. I hadn't expected to get 100% germination on the seeds I started, so I have quite a few more plants than I had originally planned for.This kit has everything I need to start canning sauce when the tomatoes are ripe. I did a \"dry run\" to see how well it would probably work and it performed just as well as the product page claimed. I may try a small batch of peach jam or jelly if we get any decent peaches off the tree this year.I think this kit is an excellent value, especially for a beginner. I wouldn't hesitate to get one as a gift for someone interested in learning to can. I also wouldn't hesitate to order another for myself, and probably will.","purchase_model":"Color: Green Color: Green  Reviews","score":"5.0","date":"2023-06-18 15:34:06"},{"user":"Laura","content":"There\u2019s no time like the present to start learning how to can some of the harvest from the garden. Last year we had such good luck with tomatoes and hot peppers that I wish I paid attention as a younger person, when Mom & Dad were canning.This year I\u2019m going to go for it a some canning. This set seems to have all of the necessary canning tools for a beginner like myself, including a rack to hold and remove the hot as from the water. Along with silicone dipped tongs and other tools so you don\u2019t burn yourself.This is a helpful beginners set.","purchase_model":"Color: Green Color: Green  Reviews","score":"5.0","date":"2023-06-24 15:34:06"},{"user":"Middle Path","content":"While I haven't gotten to use this yet, I'm excited to but I'm in the middle of a move with all my stuff in storage and waiting to get to the permanent place. Been getting into prepping and food storage, but hadn't gotten into canning yet. This set contains everything! And I'll probably be using that jar opener regularly as my darn grip strength is not what it used to be, and I have trouble twisting off tops now. Excellent value.","purchase_model":"Color: Green Color: Green  Reviews","score":"5.0","date":"2023-05-26 15:34:06"},{"user":"sean","content":"This is a perfect beginner\u2019s kit for canning. It includes everything you need to get started, and is a very reasonable price. All you need are some jars and a pot, and everything else is in this kit. The quality is pretty great! It\u2019s not the most professional quality like an expert might have, but it\u2019s perfect for those who have only dabbled in canning and can\u2019t justify buying a really fancy canning set. As a test run, I canned one jar of beans, and it worked great. I\u2019m growing cucamelons this year and I can\u2019t wait to pickle them with this kit!","purchase_model":"Color: Green Color: Green  Reviews","score":"5.0","date":"2023-05-26 15:34:06"},{"user":"Jimmie Mack","content":"If you are new to canning, this is a great tool set to get you going.It even includes a basket to put in a canner or large pot.This is something I haven\u2019t seen in years sold separately.The bright green also is a nice touch.The tools appear to be well made.A very reasonable price for the quality of the product.The description is accurate of what you get in the set.","purchase_model":"Color: Green Color: Green  Reviews","score":"5.0","date":"2023-05-19 15:34:06"},{"user":"JungleGrape","content":"This kit took the fear out of being a beginner canner and how to start.
