	var commentsList = [{"user":"Twin02","content":"I am absolutely thrilled with my recent purchase of the Round Canning Rack Stainless Steel with 2\" Height Legs, specifically for use with my Instant Pot Pro Crisp + Airfryer. This versatile rack has completely transformed my cooking experience, particularly when using the air fryer and sous vide functions.First and foremost, the quality of this rack is outstanding. Constructed from durable stainless steel with heavyweight cross-wire design, it's built to last and withstands the high temperatures associated with air frying and sous vide cooking. The 2-inch height legs elevate the rack perfectly, ensuring optimal airflow and even cooking or heating from all sides.Using this rack for air frying has been a game-changer. It provides excellent support and allows hot air to circulate around food evenly, resulting in crispy, golden-brown perfection every time. Whether I'm air frying chicken wings our getting a nice sear on my steaks I cooked on the Sous Vide setting, the results are consistently delicious and evenly cooked.I've found this rack to be incredibly useful for sous vide cooking. Its sturdy construction and perfect fit in my Instant Pot Pro Crisp + Airfryer make it ideal for allowing the water to circulate evenly around the vaccum sealed steaks.Cleanup is a breeze with this rack.

Since this rack is 2 inches high with a 12-inch diameter, it was perfect for my use. I was able to cook between 16-18 bite size frozen chicken nuggets at 325F in 15 minutes. Also, cooked 4 frozen burger patties at 400F in 15-18 minutes, depending on personal preference. Be sure to place the rack on top of a 13-inch round pizza pan to catch any drippings.Cleaning the rack wasn't too bad. Let it cool completely to the touch, scrape off any stuck food bits with your fingernails, wash with a sponge soaked in dish soap, rinse thoroughly and dry with cloth towel. The total cleaning time was approximately 5 minutes +/-. Great rack and highly recommended.","purchase_model":"Size: Dia 12&#034;   Reviews","score":"5.0","date":"2022-05-28 15:34:06"},{"user":"D.

I had been combining 2 other racks to do that job but the legs on this rack are taller & better suited for the task. Regardless, anything involved with cooking food needs to be covered with foil to save more work. So, make sure you have that on hand also.","purchase_model":"Size: Dia 7.9&#034;   Reviews","score":"5.0","date":"2025-02-12 15:34:06"},{"user":"Amazon Customer","content":"easy to use","purchase_model":"Size: Dia 9.5&#034;   Reviews","score":"5.0","date":"2024-12-03 15:34:06"},{"user":"RJDA","content":"PERFECT!Finally, a grate/grill for the inside of my 8-quart Instant Pot which fits perfectly, yet leaves plenty of room for liquids and juices to collect in the bottom!I am now able to:1. pour in the liquid2. toss in the herbs and etc. in the liquid3. put my meat and veggies & herbs on the grate4. set the timing and temp(s)5. if I wish, even baste some liquid over everything6. close the lid7. turn it on.8.
